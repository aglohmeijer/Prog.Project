# Problem and proposal
My previous idea with the linked dot connection seemed to complicated and ambitious, as it involved a search engine combined with a visualization instead of solely a visualization. In order to that conclusion I propose a new visualization:

An interactive sunburst visualization which depicts the CO2 emmission per country via multiple levels. The main level of the sunburst is the worldwide CO2 emission, the second level is the CO2 emission per continent, the third the CO2 level per country in that corresponding continent and the last level is how the CO2 emission is divided (Agricultural, vehicles, factories etc.), but I am not sure whether I will be able to found that Data which is what I am doing at the moment (searching). The sunburst visualization should be linked to a time shift such that you can traverse through the last 20 years and therewith get a good impression of the CO2 emission development per continent or country.

# Dataset
I can obtain the data from the world DataBank, however I did not yet find any data on the subdistribution in between one country.
