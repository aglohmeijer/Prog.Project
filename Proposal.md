# Proposal
I am inspired by the occasion which happens often at home, namely where my roommates and I cannot decide which movie to watch. There is this website called TasteKid, where you fill in some films, authors and genres you like and subsequently the website generates a few suggestions based on your personal preferences. Based on this website I have been thinking about combining the search engine of TasteKid with D3 visualization or buildng solely visualization where attributes are the linking items.

- IDEA 1: Rebuild/copy the TasteKid suggestion in an alternative way where the accent is layed on the visualization rather than the search engine itself;
- IDEA 3: Instead of a 'search engine' I am thinking of just building a linked visualization between authors/genres/movies and so on.
